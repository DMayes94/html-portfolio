<h1>About me</h1>
<p>My name is Diamond Mayes and I work as a web developer. I am new to becomming a web developer and I am working hard to perfect my craft. I have been interested in programming for quite some time, and I have finally decided to pursue that passion full time. I believe that I am a very ambitious person who loves working to make the website work well. Working on the web is my desired passion as I have found that I love to work on fun and exciting projects.</p>
<p>I have a background working for the government as a respected mail handler for seven years, as well as a certified union official for two years. Hard work and dedication is instilled in me. I would like to think of myself as highly motivated and if compared to any animal, I would say I most compare to a beaver because of how meticulous they are when building their dams. Needless to say, precision is key for me.</p>
<p>Every day I spend at least two or more hours on the computer looking for ways to do better at coding. Deciding to transition to the technical world was a decision I have long waited for. I look forward to all there is to come from this journey of being an entry-level web developer.</p>
